# Bias_corrected_timeseries
Scripts to perform bias correction of temperature time series as described in 
Ortega-Cisneros et al. 2024.  
  
The `scripts` folder contains three `Rmarkdown` files describing how to perform
temperature bias correction under different scenarios, and within two FishMIP
regional model boundaries.  
  
The data used in this repository is available in the `data` folder. However, you
can download data from any FishMIP regional model using the following link:
